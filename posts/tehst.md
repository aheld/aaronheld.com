I attended a book signing and talk by [Harry Boonin](http://www.boonin.com/) at [Kesher Isreal](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&q=kesher+israel&near=Philadelphia,+PA&fb=1&cid=39942639,-75149153,8115982947485271748&li=lmd&ll=39.942713,-75.149145&spn=0.041326,0.072098&z=14&iwloc=A) today.  He gave an interesting talk about the history of the temple and an insight into the history of the Jews in Philly.  An interesting bit was his mention of a part of the building's history where the Christian community collaborated with the Jewish community during a move and had mutual respect for each others religious paraphernalia.  I have to wonder how the different communities could understand each other without wikipedia!
