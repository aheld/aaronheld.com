Taking of Pelham 123 on Fancast!

I went looking for the trailer of the original Pelham 123 and was plesantly surprised to find the full lenght movie on Fancast!

This was one of my favorite movies as a kid and well worth watching. There are some comments out there about how this is a well done film in terms of pacing, so I hope that they model that in the remake.
