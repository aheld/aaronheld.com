What better first post for my renovated, Philly style blog, then to mention "Glock Day".

A local range in the city [(Philadelphia Archery and Gun Club)](http://www.philadelphiaarcheryandgunclub.com/) hosted some helpful representatives from [Glock](http://www.glock.com/ "Glock") and offered free test firing of their models.

The staff was helpful and it was fun.  It reminded me of testing racing skis at [Killington](http://www.killington.com/winter/index.html).  Except less of the fresh mountain air and more of the smell of gunpowder.
