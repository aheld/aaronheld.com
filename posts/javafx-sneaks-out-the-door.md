Sun released version 1 of javaFX today - [http://www.javafx.com/](http://www.javafx.com/)

Its a competitor to Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight, but based on the java developer created demos it just does not look complelling enough to matter.

Adobe had been making some great progress in the Flash virtual machine and the number of advances in Flash10 really impress the coder in me.  As a development manager I'm seeing Actionscript programmers reach an impressive level of maturity, with unit testing, automated builds and solid object design.

I'm interested enough in this to want to dig in more but no project in my queue comes to mind.  I'm only using Flash now for video players.

So for now I'm downloading this technology and looking for a problem.......
