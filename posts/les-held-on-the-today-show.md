My father was featured on Hoda's Bucket list segment on the Today show.

My dad never really wanted to talk about his past in public, but recently he met one of the soldiers from the US 30th Infantry who rescued him. With the passing of the last of the group who rescued him, he now wants to ensure his story is told. The today show segment didn't go into detail of his rescue, but men like Matthew Rozell and Frank Towers have documented it here https://teachinghistorymatters.com/2016/03/01/the-last-transport/

The Today Show did a great job of telling his story and I'm appreciate of the support he as gotten since.
