So tonight my 10 year old decided that she wanted to learn flash. We are going through a basic tutorial but she decided to make a cat (rather then a circle) walk across the screen.

This is clearly scope creep! There was budgeted time after dinner and before bed for a circle slide, not a walking mammal.

After some time she said that it didn't look right and wanted to spend more time in order to make it walk more realistically. I said that it was bedtime. Like any good developer faced with their project time getting cut she looked to reduce scope.

Ardith puts little circles under its feed, compiles and says,"Look - roller skates!"

The requirement of a cat moving across screen has been satisfied.....
