My girlfriend's mom bought her one of those inexpensive 'wireless' notebook mouses.Â  It is not even bluetooth enabled, it requires a USB adapter.

I used it over the weekend and found it much better then my hip Apple mouse. Although I can't squeeze it ( [www.apple.com/mightymouse/](http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/) ) it is much easier to use.

The tilt wheel concept is more precise then the little ball on the apple and the optical sensor works across any surface. This mouse works on my office desk where the apple mouse fails (and a dog did eat my mousepad)

Anyway consider this a product endorsement, and go get a Logitech v200. I'm off to find a bluetooth version....
