Just watched [Taken](http://www.fancast.com/movies/Taken/141653/full-movie ) and it was a well done film.

It had a pace more akin to the Bourne movies with a better actor at the helm. I don't know why it didn't do so well at the box office, I thought that it had more emotional impact then any recent spy type movies I've seen. The action sequences were more of a desperate warrior then a calm martial artist and every scene imparted tension.

I recommend watching it and I'm definitely sure that as a parent I'm never letting my kids travel alone......
