The vote turnout is really impressive. Its more like a party or superbowl. Actually from the high quality tv spots this election is definitely nearing superbowl quality. Maybe we need to let Fox and CNN bid for exclusive coverage rights....

Anyway after I voted I took the kiddies to vote: \[caption id="attachment\_42" align="alignnone" width="320" caption="Ardith voting "\][![Ardith voting ](/assets/posts/images/img_2713.jpg "ardith_vote")](http://www.aaronheld.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_2713.jpg)\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_43" align="alignnone" width="320" caption="Molly votes in Bucks county kid election"\][![Molly votes in Bucks county kid election](/assets/posts/images/img_2711.jpg "molly_vote")](http://www.aaronheld.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_2711.jpg)\[/caption\]

The culture is so different now.

What is next for civil duties? People actually wanting to serve on Juries?
