I thoroughly enjoyed the Iron Man movie. My son wanted more of a [SpaceMarine](http://us.games-workshop.com/games/40K/spacemarines/default.htm) clunky feel to the armor, but I though they nailed exactly how I saw Iron Man from my youth.

At least half the theater stayed past the credit roll, I was surprised by how many people knew about the extra bit.

It took some real willpower to sit through the endless list of names after consuming a super giant-sized soda and getting to a 2 hour movie 45min early
