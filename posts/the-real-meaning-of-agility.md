Agility is one of the most abused terms in my profession.

Recent events in my day job have caused me to rethink what agility means.  We have a very elegant, loosely coupled system that allows us to build entire sections of our website in hours.  The framework handles everything from CDN integration to doing automated profiling every build.

Software engineers have to be good at identifying the bottleneck, and over the past few days I saw how the larger teams ability to react mattered much more then the codebase itself.

This is a topic I'll have to explore after some rest
