I love to rant over how bad HOAs are.  There are so many case studies in my life where otherwise happy friendly people become tyrants when given a bit of power.  From the band leader that threatened my wedding would be a failure to the people that run the Home Owners Associations.

It takes a certain type of fellow to run an HOA.  My buck's county HOA is much better then the one in Manalanapan.  They forced me to keep human feces in my garage, (more about dirty diapers and not allowing a gargage can to be on the side of the house) and would not let a neighbor keep a boat in the lot because it was not a car.

I have not been in my current place long enough to have any issues but I think the culture and spirit of the HOA is well captured by this web form that they host.
