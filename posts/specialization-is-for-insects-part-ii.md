Came across the Heinlein quote again today: http://personalmba.com/core-human-skills

this time in the context of a "Business" professional. There is another point made in the blog post about how to be successful. You can either be an expert in a narrow field (top 1%) or be very good (top 25%) in multiple fields. The author calls these "Core Human Skills"

This is worth a read, and I will definitely abstract these concepts out in my interview process.
