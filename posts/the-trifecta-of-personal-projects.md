The joys of home ownership pressing demands at work have stifled my personal innovation time. Sometime in the last millennium I used be enjoy writing exploratory projects and releasing libraries that others may find useful.

Over the last few months I've been looking for inspiration for a project that would help me explore some 'search' related ideas that have been bouncing in my head.

I came across a project idea that represents the perfect personal trifecta!

1) It involves a technology I'm currently interesting in learning

2) It solves a real world problem that affects me (and many more like me ;) personally

3) My mom likes it

I have the domain name, I have the technology, don't have a UI worth showing and absolutely no features work yet! But soon I will unveil this and learn if being desperate to use my mother for innovations works.
