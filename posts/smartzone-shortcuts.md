I'm starting to get used to Comcast's [smartzone webmail front end](http://www.comcast.net/smartzone/ "Smartzone").  It is an ajaxy / desktopish mail client that exposes way more functionality then the old one.

This type of functionality usually comes at a price, and in this case the price was having to use a mouse.

There are a number of keyboard shortcuts, but the it is a full page help buried in the preferences pane.  I prefer the narrow right-hand window like the type seen in some Microsoft office products.

So I copied the docs and make a little bookmarklet for myself.  Feel free to use it.

[Smartzone Keyboard Shortcuts](javascript:(function(){var width = 350;var top   = 150;var height=screen.height - top;var left  =screen.width  - width;var winpop=open( 'http://www.aaronheld.com/wp-content/shortcuts.html', 'win', 'scrollbars=yes,resizeable=no,menubar=no,toolbar=no,width='+width+',height='+height+',left='+left+',top='+top);})() "Shortcuts")

To use this as a bookmarklet, just drag it over to your bookmark or favorites bar!
